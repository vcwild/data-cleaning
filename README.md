# Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

> This is a step-by-step project for getting and cleaning data sets. It includes the instructions on how to do an analysis on Human Activity by using the UCI Irvine Machine Learning repositories.


## Files

- *raw data set*: [Human activity recognition using smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
- *[CODEBOOK.md](https://github.com/vcwild/data-cleaning/blob/master/CODEBOOK.md)*: step-by-step on how to get from the raw data to the tidy data set.
- *[run_analysis.R](https://github.com/vcwild/data-cleaning/blob/master/run_analysis.R)*: a script able to process and clean the raw data into the final tidy data set (and export into a *.txt file)
- *[cleanData.txt](https://github.com/vcwild/data-cleaning/blob/master/cleanData.txt)*: the exported tidy data set generated by the *run_analysis.R* script.

### Note

In order for the *run_analysis.R* script to work, you need to download the raw data set library and extract as an entire folder inside the project root folder.
