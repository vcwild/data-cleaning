## Files

- *raw data set*: [Human activity recognition using smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
- *CODEBOOK.md*: step-by-step on how to get from the raw data to the tidy data set.
- *run_analysis.R*: a script able to process and clean the raw data into the final tidy data set (and export into a *.txt file)
- *cleanData.txt*: the exported tidy data set generated by the *run_analysis.R* script.
